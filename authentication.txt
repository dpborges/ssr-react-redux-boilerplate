Note when using google Oauth, you are using cookie based authentication, 
which is fine when authenticating via a browser using a SPA. If browser
authenticates directly with the API, users will be able to authenticate.

The question is, how do we make that cookie available to the server, so
browser thinks cookie came from server.
