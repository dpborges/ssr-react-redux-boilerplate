Server side
=============
1) - Match the url path to a route to figure what component neends to be rendered.
2) - Call the loadData() function  attached to each component and wait till data set is returned
3) - Detect when all requests are completed (using promise.all)
4) - Render app using data that has been populated in redux store
5) - Send result back to browser.
