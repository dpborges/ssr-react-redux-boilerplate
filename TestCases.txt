API testing 

This the base url for the API: https://react-ssr-api.herokuapp.com
These are the routes for that API
  /         API Documentation
  /users    Return users list
  /admins   Return list of admins
  /auth/google starts auth process
  /current_user return info about current user logged in
  /logout   Log out of application

  
To see if react ssr is available type in the url for the api https://react-ssr-api.herokuapp.com.
Once on the page, you will see whether you're logged in or logged out.

If not logged in, log yourself in. You can confirm if logged if page says "You appear to be logged in"



Scripted Test case 
======================================================================================
- Click users link to see if I can see list of users.
- Click admins link to see if I can see list of admins. Should fail if not logged in.
- Log in and see that I can login successfully using google auth.
- Click Admins button to see if I can see admins list
- Logoff and check that I can no longer see Admins List but able to see users list.
