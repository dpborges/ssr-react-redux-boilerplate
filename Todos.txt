Read through non coding videos and stop at coding videos and document code base.

 - Next up: Run the test script. Make sure everything works with react-redux boilerplate.
 - Make copy of React Redux boilerplate as react hooks boilerplate
 - See if there is git repo for hooks udemy class that was given. If so, clone that repo
 - Read documentation and/or video to the point where I understand Hooks and the Context API clearly.
 - View the section on how to migrate Redux to Hooks and start implementing those changes
   on the react-hooks on the client side.
 - Once you migrate hooks on client side, identify what would need to change on server side.
   Make those changes then Run test script again to see if everything is working.
