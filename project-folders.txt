Everything in the client folder is effectively shared between the server side and the client side.
All of the following are shared:

        - actions
        - components
        - pages
        - reducers
        - App.js
        - Routes.js

The server side components is the src/index.js file and files in helpers folder:

        - createStorel.js
        - renderer.js
