Questions to ask yourself when going through the Hooks documentation and video.

    How do I create a combined store with Hooks and useState?

    How do I simulate an action / action creator?

    How do I dispatch an action?

    How do I simulate a reducer, that is watching for actions?

    How do I make pieces of state avaiable as props to a given component?

    How do I simulate a Provider that passes down state to my application?
